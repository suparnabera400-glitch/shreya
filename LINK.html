<H2><I> Happy Birthday!
To my best friend, my partner in crime, and one of the most precious parts of my life! You’re not just my friend — you’re my family, my safe place, and the person who understands me even when I can’t find the right words.

From our endless laughs to the moments we’ve held each other through tough times, you’ve been a constant source of love, support, and joy in my life. I’m so grateful for every memory we’ve made and every dream we’ve shared, and I can’t wait for all the adventures that still lie ahead.

Today is all about celebrating you — your beautiful soul, your kindness, your strength, and the way you make the world brighter just by being in it. I hope this year brings you nothing but happiness, success, and all the love you truly deserve.

Cheers to you, my forever person, my best friend for life!</I></H2>
